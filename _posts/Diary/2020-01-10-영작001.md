# Air-crash in Iraq sky
Between U.S and Iraq break out the air-crash accident which could have been a great war. Iraq has suspected air-crash accident because of this happened in the Iraq sky. I think Trump takes advantage of this accident. Because this accident caused for the U.S to retaliate to Iraq.

# U.S side opinion
This accident is an inhuman act, We are very sorry that this has happened. We have evidence that the incident was caused by an Iraq missile.

# Iraq side opinion
Evidence from his country's fighter aviation data claimed no missile strikes.

# The cause of the accident currently under consideration
* A mid-air collision with a drone or other flying object
* engine destruction/explosion due to technical reasons
* an explosion inside the plane as a result of terror attack

# Future prospects I think
Even if this happened in Iraq, it would work against Iraq. Internationally, Iraq would be on the defensive, and eventually, This happening make the US laugh
